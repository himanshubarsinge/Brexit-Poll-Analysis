# Brexit-Poll-Analysis
In June 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum to determine whether the country would “Remain” in the European Union (EU) or “Leave” the EU. This referendum is commonly known as Brexit. In this project, we will analyze real Brexit polling data to develop polling models to forecast Brexit results.
